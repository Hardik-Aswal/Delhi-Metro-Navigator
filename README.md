# Delhi-Metro-Navigator
A  DSA project based on Dijkstra's Algorithm that tells users the shortest path while traveling in the Delhi Metro 
Everyone is well-known for Google Maps. Google Maps is an efficient application showing the shortest path from source to destination.
Google Maps application is built using Dijkstra's algorithm.  
We can build the same application for the metro using Dijkstra's algorithm
Using the edge values, Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently finds the minimum distance between nodes.
We can consider the stations as nodes and distance as edges; by using Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest time path and shortest cost path.
